      <p>Angie was born in California. She lived there until she was 12 years old, and then she and her family moved to south Florida. Angie graduated from high school and took some college courses.
      Angie met a friend named Carol, and Carol introduced Angie to her cousin Patrick. Patrick lived in Utah, and Angie started emailing him and talking to him over the phone. They fell in love and got married. Angie moved to Utah, and a year later, she had her first child.
      Angie went back to school and earned her associate degree. Then she had another kid, and a couple more kids followed. Angie became a mom of four, two girls and two boys. She stayed at home to raise her kids, but always wanted to return to school.
      Angie always told her kids how important it was to get an education and continues to support her kids in their educational goals. In 2019 she went back to school at Utah Valley University and earned a bachelor’s degree in family sciences. After that, Angie went to the University of Kentucky to earn a master’s degree in social work. During her schooling, she had to complete internships. Angie interned with a food bank, for a hospice, and for a shelter for victims of domestic violence. Angie moved into play therapy, and she enjoys the creative side of it. She uses techniques of cognitive behavioral therapy, and sand therapy. The child gets to lead the play, and Angie loves teaching kids tools to lower their stress and anxiety.
      When Angie is not at work, she can be found at home with her two dogs and family, or traveling.
