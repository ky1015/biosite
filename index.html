        <p>Angie has earned a master’s degree in social work from the University of Kentucky. Her internship focused on serving diverse populations such as: survivors of domestic violence and their children, hospice patients and their families,
         and people facing food insecurity in her local community. She earned her Bachelor of Science in Family Sciences from Utah Valley University and has a provisional certification as a Certified Family Life Educator (CFLE-P).
         She made the Dean’s List every semester, and graduated summa cum laude from UVU. While going to school, she raised her family of four children and was supported by her loving husband. Angie inspired her kids to love learning as much as she does and has always wanted them to pursue higher education.
         She is now working towards becoming a registered play therapist and hopes to work with diverse populations of children in the future. Angie is interested in Sand Play Therapy, as she thinks it is a good way for clients to express difficult concepts or feelings.
         Play is an essential part of being human, and kids learn so much through playing.</p>
