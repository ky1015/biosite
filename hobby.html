        <p>Angie loves to travel! She has planned many family vacations over the years. Her husband loves Disney, so they took their kids to the Disney Parks when they could. Now, three out of her four kids work at Disney World and so Angie gets to visit there often! Angie lived in Utah, so she traveled into the mountains often for hikes or camping trips. She also visited Southern Utah which is a unique landscape. Angie’s favorite place to travel to is Hawaii, she loves that it has mountains like Utah and is tropical like Florida. To her, it feels like a mix of the places she’s lived. One day, Angie hopes to travel internationally and visit her ancestral countries. Her most recent trip was to Georgia and South Carolina to enjoy some of the southeastern states. Her next trip is to California to enjoy the Pacific Ocean and visit family.</p>
